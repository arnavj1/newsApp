<!-- This application was made so that users can create accounts and view the latest news and weather info. I've used authentication and passport and mongodb to allow users to create accounts and log into them. Likewise, I used weather and news APIs to pull data from a third party. 

I would like to give credit to the Professor for his starter code on authentication. I would also like to acknowledge my friend Sally Zhao who helped me with some of the front-end design of the project.  -->
